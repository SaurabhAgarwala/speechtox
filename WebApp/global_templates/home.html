    <p style="text-align: center;">SpeechTox is an application which detects toxicity of words used in a content. It is developed using HTML, CSS, JS and Django, and integrates a Machine Learning model.<br><br>
        The machine learning model has been trained on the following Kaggle dataset: <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/c/jigsaw-toxic-comment-classification-challenge">https://www.kaggle.com/c/jigsaw-toxic-comment-classification-challenge.</a> It is used to predict the following categories given any text: toxic, severe_toxic, obscene, threat, insult and identity_hate. The model is trained using Logistic Regression on the text after tokenising it using tf-idf.<br><br>
        The application serves the following purposes:<br>
        1)Given any text, it lists the categories of language content it fits in.<br>
        2)Given a song title and artist, it again displays the categories of language content it fits in.<br>
        3)Given a billboard playlist and number of items, it classifies the songs in the playlist into two categories: decent and indecent.<br>
